  ## Description
Portfolio Generator collects all the information you need to create a high-quality web-based developer's portfolio and generates the html and css files to deploy to GitHub Pages or other website.  

Information is stored in a mongo database on Heroku so it can be retrieved and edited at any time.

The generated portfolio includes:  
 * About Me with optional photo and short bio
 * Developer's skill list
 * Projects you've worked on, including thumbnail images, live links, video walkthrough link, and GitHub repository information
 * Social media contact information 

Originally developed as a group project through University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp

## User Story: 

As a professional working in the tech industry, I need a high-quality web-based portfolio that will make it easy for employers to get to know me and my skills.

When I run the Portfolio-Generator, I see a brief introduction and the option to either Sign up or Login.

Once I sign up or login, I have access to  Portfolio Generator sections for entering my Developer Information, Social Media Links, and a list of Projects I've worked on. 

When I expand the Developer Information, I can specify my (required) name, (required) profile image, phone number, and a short, required "About Me" biography, as well as selecting from a large list of optional developer skills (and icons) that to include in the portfolio.

When I expand the Social Medial section, I can optionallyl provide account urls for a variety of social media platforms.

When I expand the Projects section, I see a list of any projects that were previously specified, together with a button to add a new project. 

When I click ``Add New Project``, a form expands that lets me enter a (required) title, (required) thumbnail image filename, link to deployed application, github repository link, video link, organization, and (required) short description.

When I click ``Save`` in any of the sectons, the information in that area is written to a mongoDB database so it it can be retrieved and edited at a later date.

When I click ``Create Portfolio Zip File`` the HTML and css files for my portfolio are downloaded to my computer.

When I unpack the zip files, I place  ``index.html`` in a directory of my choosing, place the ``styles.css`` in an ``assets/css`` subdirectory, and place any images I've included in the project in an ``assets/images`` subdirectory so they can be loaded propertly by the html file.

When I load my ``index.html`` file into a web browser, I see a single-page portfolio with "About Me" and "Contact" information, social media links, and a list of projects that includes both image thumbnails and application links.
